Summary: Compare "I tend to build things 3 times" with "I enclose things in boxes for Draft No. 4". 

Compare:

> I tend to build things 3 times, the first is sort of an exploration of the space, I fiddle around with usually just a bit of data and an extremely rudimentary UI to figure out what it is that I really want to build. Then when thatâ€™s sort of crystalized out I build the second version, one that lives for a while, days, weeks or months. This usually has actual use(rs) and maps out the space even further. Inevitably this turns up some really bad decisions made in the first or the second phase that were not apparent at the time. And so after a relatively short time the whole thing gets ripped apart again and then I build it in a way that it can last for a decade or longer while keeping the exterior unchanged as much as possible.

With:

>It is toward the end of the second draft, if I'm lucky, when the feeling comes over me that I have something I want to show to other people, something that seems to be working and is not going away. The feeling is more than welcome, yes, but it is hardly euphoria. It's just a new lease on life, sense that I'm going to survive until the middle of next month. After reading the second draft aloud, and going through the piece for a third time (removing the tin horns and radio static that I heard while reading), I enclose things in boxes for Draft No. 4. If I enjoy anything in this process it is Draft No. 4...you draw a box not only around any word that does not seem quite right but also around words that fulfill their assignment but seem to present an opportunity.
